      <h1>
        Fresh Bytes aims to tackle the issue of food wastage due to cosmetic
        filtering. It aims to provide a centralised platform to connect F&B
        businesses, corporations, and individuals and create a means of
        re-distribution for products and produce that are close to expiry or
        have been deemed cosmetically unsellable. Ultimately, this would
        redistribute fresh and edible products that would have typically
        thrown away to customers at a discounted price.

      <h1 class="title is-5"><i>Did you know?</i></h1>
      <h1>
        Over the past 10 years, Singapore has generated an average of 750
        thousand tonnes of food waste annually (National Environment Agency,
        2021). Unfortunately, recycling efforts have not kept up with this
        growing statistic – as of 2019, only a mere 18% of food waste was
        recycled (National Environment Agency, 2021), with the remainder being
        incinerated.

      <h1 class="title is-5"><i>What is Ugly Food?</i></h1>
      <h1>
        A large contributor to food waste in Singapore is Cosmetic Filtering,
        whereby "Ugly Food" that is perceived to be damaged or ‘ugly’ by
        personal standards are discarded despite still being fresh and edible.
        The practice of Cosmetic Filtering occurs most often in local farms, wet
        and wholesale markets and supermarkets. At Sheng Siong, a local
        supermarket in Singapore, it is estimated that 10 to 15% of total fresh
        produce stocks are thrown away due to cosmetic blemishes.

      <h1 class="title is-5"><i>What can we do?</i></h1>
      <h1>
        We can play an active role to reduce food wastage due to comestic
        filtering of "Ugly Food" by purchasing from wholesalers like Fresh Bytes
        who collaborate with businesses to create a market to resell such
        products and produce! Most importantly, you can help to spread awareness
        about this cause to your family and friends.

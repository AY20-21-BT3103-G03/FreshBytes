      <p>
        Food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore and the
        amount of food waste generated has grown by around
        <b>20% over the last 10 years.</b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2019, Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food waste. That
        is equivalent to 2 bowls of rice per person per day, or around 51,000
        double decker buses.
